# Sustainable Design and Planning Using Generative AI

A comprehensive academic project demonstrating how Generative AI can support sustainable design and planning through constraint-aware generation, sustainability evaluation, and interactive decision-support.

## Overview

This is a **decision-support system** that generates and optimizes sustainable design alternatives based on user-defined constraints and sustainability metrics, while respecting real-world feasibility and planning constraints.

### Problem Statement
Sustainable urban and product design requires balancing environmental, economic, and social constraints. Traditional manual design processes struggle to explore complex solution spaces efficiently. Designers face difficulty in evaluating multiple sustainable alternatives, integrating real-world constraints such as regulations, climate, and budget, and scaling design efforts for large projects.

### Proposed Solution
A Generative AI–based decision-support system that:
- Generates design alternatives based on constraints
- Evaluates sustainability impact using rule-based metrics
- Provides interactive comparison and visualization
- Supports informed decision-making with explainability

- **Area** slider (300–2000 sq ft)
- **Budget Level** slider (0–100%)
- **Climate Type** selector (cold / moderate / hot)
- **Sustainability Priority** selector (energy / water / materials)

Constraints are validated and processed through a rule-based logic engine.

### 3. Generative AI Design Module (Simulated)
Generates 3 design alternatives:
- **Eco-Efficient Design** 🌱 - Energy-focused passive systems

Each design includes:
- Detailed description
- Suggested materials
- Key features
- Sustainability strategies

### 4. Sustainability Impact Evaluation
Each design is evaluated using:
- **Energy Efficiency Score** (0–100%)
  - Based on passive design, thermal performance, renewable readiness
- **Carbon Footprint** (Low / Medium / High)
  - Combined assessment of embodied and operational carbon
- **Water Efficiency Score** (0–100%)
  - Based on water management strategies and climate adaptation

Additional metrics:
- Estimated project cost
- Payback period for sustainable features
- Lifecycle carbon analysis

### 5. Interactive Comparison & Visualization
- Card-based display of all alternatives
- Automatic highlighting of best-performing design
- Multiple visualization types:
  - Bar charts for performance metrics
  - Radar charts for multi-dimensional analysis
  - Cost comparison visualizations
- Summary statistics and rankings

### 6. AI Generation Experience

## Sustainability Methodology

### Energy Efficiency Scoring
```
Base Score (50) +
  Budget Boost (0-20 points) +
  Priority Weight (0-15 points) +
  Climate Adjustment (-5 to +5) +
  Area Efficiency (0-8 points)
= Energy Score (0-100)
```

### Water Efficiency Scoring
```
Base Score (50) +
  Priority Weight (0-25 points) +
  Budget Boost (0-15 points) +
  Climate Adjustment (0-20 points) +
  Area Efficiency (0-8 points)
= Water Score (0-100)
```

### Carbon Footprint Assessment
- Combines energy efficiency and embodied carbon estimates
- Categorical: Low (< 18 kg CO2e/sqft) / Medium / High

### Sustainability Index
Weighted average of energy and water scores:
- Energy-priority: 60% energy + 40% water
- Water-priority: 40% energy + 60% water
- Materials-priority: 50% energy + 50% water
